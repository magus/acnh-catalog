# Animal Crossing New Horizons Catalog

## TODO

- do not alpha sort items (easier to track in same order)

- tapping remove on item shifts hover state to another item, just remove hover state

- add tiny button to show tags below search that let you filter everything to the matches category
- wallpaper accessory etc.  will make easier to use

- Find a better item catalog
  - A lot of items have variants that do not match villager db
  - e.g. Nose Drip, Laptop, Floor Lamp

- Lighthouse CI Github Action
  - deploy to zeit, use preview url for lighthouse ci github action
